Exploring stake pools
IOHK has developed a stake pool metadata aggregation server (SMASH) to provide the community with a list of verified stake pools with valid metadata. Smash is integrated with the Daedalus wallet, and users can see a list of valid stake pools in the delegation center tab. 

You can also explore stake pools using these tools:
