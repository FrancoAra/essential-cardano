# The essential Cardano list #

The essential Cardano list provides a map of the Cardano ecosystem and a central library of materials, including official IOG, Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo resources, as well as community-generated materials. 

This list is fully open source so we hope that you can help us to grow and fine tune our recommendations to make our list even better. We encourage you to let us know of new content that is being produced by the community, new relationships, new innovations, so that we can add them all to this list and build out the ecosystem.

## Exploring stake pools ##
IOHK has developed a [stake pool metadata aggregation server (SMASH)](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/getting-started/stake-pool-operators/SMASH-metadata-management.html) to provide the community with a list of verified stake pools with valid metadata. Smash is integrated with the Daedalus wallet, and users can see a list of valid stake pools in the delegation center tab. 

You can also explore stake pools using these tools:
- [Cardano PoolTool](https://pooltool.io/)
