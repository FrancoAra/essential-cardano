# The essential Cardano list #

‘*One list to rule them all...*’

Welcome to [the essential Cardano list](https://github.com/nahern/essential-cardano/blob/main/essential-cardano-list.md), a comprehensive collection of resources to help you learn more about Cardano. Whether you want to understand what Cardano is, learn about our mission and roadmap, or get stuck in and build on Cardano, this is the place to start. 

The Essential Cardano list is designed to be a central library of materials, a one stop shop where you can find various resources for Cardano. This list includes official resources and community-generated materials. It is open source and we hope that you can help us to grow and fine tune this list to make it even better. We encourage you to add to this list by raising a PR in the repo with suggestions and new additions to enhance our list.
